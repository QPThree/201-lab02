## About Me

About-me app prompts the user with 5 yes or no questions "about-me".  The user will have entered a username which the program will occassionally use to address the user.  

The initial quiz consists of 5 basic questions 'About-Me'.  A global varial is used to keep track of the users answers through the experience of this page.  

A 6th question is a higher / lower game for the user to play.  A while loop asks the user to guess a number.  The loop breaks when the user has 4 incorrect guesses OR the user get the correct guess. 

The 7th question asks the user to name which Super Bowl's Tom Brady has won.  The answers are stored in an array.  The for loop gives the user 6 chances at guessing. The first correct guess will break out of the loop.  A for loop exists inside the outer loop which checks each guess against the index values in the array.  

Finally, at the end, the user is given their score.  

The page has main blocks of information down the center of the page that give the user information about me.  Answers to the quiz question can be found in these blocks.
